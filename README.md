# ScoreFreeTrees

The method used to obtain score-free trees is described in Tutz, G. (2021): Ordinal Trees and Random Forests:  Score-Free Recursive Partitioning and Improved Ensembles.
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00415.

ScoreFreeFitExample contains an example how to fit score free trees.

EvalLoopAug21 compares vaious tree methods for various data sets by splitting data into learning and validation sets.

OrdRandForestFlexible and OrdPredAug21 contain the functions needed to fit, should run first.
